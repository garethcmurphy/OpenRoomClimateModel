# 🌍 Edgeworth Box & Room Climate Stability 🌡️

Welcome to the **Edgeworth Box & Room Climate Stability** project! This project aims to simulate and visualize different aspects of room climate stability using the concept of the Edgeworth Box.

## 📚 About Edgeworth Box

The **Edgeworth Box** is a fundamental concept in microeconomics used to show the distribution of resources and the efficiency of allocations between two parties. It helps in understanding how different allocations can lead to different levels of satisfaction for the parties involved.

## 🌡️ Room Climate Stability

In this project, we extend the concept of the Edgeworth Box to analyze and visualize the stability of different room climates. We generate and plot data for various climate factors such as:

- **Thermal Climate** 🔥
- **Acoustic Climate** 🎵
- **Atmospheric Climate** 🌬️
- **Visual Climate** 👀

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OpenRoomClimateModel.git
    cd OpenRoomClimateModel
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Simulation

To generate and plot the climate data, run the following command:
```sh
python src/open_room_climate.py
```

Running Tests
To run the unit tests, use the following command:

📊 Visualization
The project generates scatter plots to visualize the relationships between different climate factors. The plots are saved as climate_plot.png and displayed using Matplotlib.
